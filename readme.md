# Legion Balance for High Metal Moons
Version 0.01

## ECONOMY
*One major issue with Legion and MLA together in shared armies is that they cannot build their metal on the same spot together. In the past, this would be problematic because Legion T1 Mass Extractor + MLA T2 Advanced Metal Extractor would generate 1 more metal per second than a pure Legion-only T1/T2 Mass setup or a pure MLA-only T1/T2 Mass setup.*

*These changes seek to amend that, and also to make balancing Legion across different types of maps easier.*

*There are a lot of ripple effects caused by this, and a good majority of the changes in this mod seek to address the effects this has on Legion's early-game economy.*

### Mass Extractor
Metal Production: 8 -> 7
Cost: 220 -> 170
Can now be built on top of MLA Advanced Metal Extractor.

### Advanced Mass Extractor
Metal Production: 14 -> 15
Cost: 2200 -> 2000
Can now be built on top of MLA Metal Extractor.

### (MLA) Metal Extractor
Can now be built on top of Legion Advanced Mass Extractor.

### (MLA) Advanced Metal Extractor
Can now be built on top of Legion Mass Extractor.

### Rig
*The Rig is effectively just a 20% better Jig in the current orbital meta, as they can stack more metal production in the same radius of gas control.*

*We've decided to amend that by increasing the Rig's explosion radius and default build separation radius, while adjusting other numbers slightly too.*

Default Build Separation Radius: 100 -> 120
Explosion Radius: 250 -> 300
Explosion Full Damage Radius: 50 -> 60

##  FOUNDRIES
*Legion Foundries currently cost a bit more; their T1 Foundries specifically cost 10% more than MLA counterparts (without faster fabrication speed). This is particularly noticeable in T1. We've brought down Legion Foundry buildcosts to be in line with MLA. This will hopefully allow them to act more aggressively in the earlygame.*

*We've also had to adjust some Legion Foundry energy usage to bring them in line with MLA too.*

### Walker Foundry
*We've also adjusted the walk-off time on the Walker Foundry in order to make it more competitive against the Bot Factory in the very early game. This might have some unintended mid-game side-effects since the T1 Walker Foundry already scales nicely.*

*For reference, the MLA Bot Factory has a walk-off time of 3, and all other T1 Legion Foundries share walk-off times with their MLA equivalents.*
Cost: 660 -> 600
Energy Usage: 640 -> 675
Walk-off Time: 4 -> 3.5

### Armour Foundry
Cost: 660 -> 600
Energy Usage: 640 -> 675

### Flyer Foundry
*The Flyer Foundry inexplicably already uses 675 energy per second, unlike its fellow T1 non-Naval Foundries. Legion is a well-polished mod.*
Cost: 660 -> 600

### Ship Foundry
Cost: 660 -> 600

### Advanced Walker Foundry
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Armour Foundry
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Flyer Foundry
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Ship Foundry
Metal Usage: 65 -> 60
Energy Usage: 1900 -> 1750

### Starcannon
*This is not an extremely well-known fact, but no factory in the game builds as fast as the Starcannon for its cost. For only 900 metal, you get production comparable to a 4500-metal T2 factory.*

*They aren't exactly commonly complained about though, so we won't touch them too much for now.*
Cost: 900 -> 1200
Metal Usage: 45 -> 35

## FABRICATORS

### Fabrication Walker
*Most competitive non-naval openings revolve heavily around the usage of MLA Bot Fabricators or Legion Fabrication Walkers. In order to compensate for the changes with T1 metal, we'll be adjusting the Fabrication Walker so it's a bit faster (albeit still slower than its MLA counterpart), costs less, and has the same fabrication rates as its MLA counterpart.*

*We hope the cheaper cost of a Fabrication Walker will help allow Legion players to get combat units onto the field earlier.*
Cost: 150 -> 135
Metal Usage: 9 -> 8
Energy Usage: 650 -> 600
Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
Health: 65 -> 50

### Armour Fabricator
*The MLA Fabrication Vehicle and Legion Armour Fabricator are much less commonly seen in openings. As a result, the speed of the Armour Fabricator is less important to the viability of Legion earlygame expansion.*

Cost: 200 -> 185
Metal Usage: 13 -> 11
Energy Usage: 850 -> 700
Build Range: 45 -> 55

### Fabrication Flyer
Cost: 225 -> 210
Metal Usage: 10 -> 9
Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Fabrication Ship
*Due to the sensitive nature of naval openings and the fact that MLA naval fabricators are already excruciatingly slow, we decided that it was best for the Fabrication Ship to have the same statistics as its MLA counterpart for now.*
Cost: 240 -> 200
Metal Usage: 16 -> 14
Energy Usage: 850 -> 800
Movement Speed: 9 -> 10


### Advanced Fabrication Walker
*We decided to take a similar approach here to the approach we took with the T1 Armour Fabricator*
Cost: 2000 -> 1800
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 2200 -> 1800
Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
Build Range: 45 -> 60
Health: 150 -> 250

### Advanced Armour Fabricator
Cost: 2250 -> 2025
Metal Usage: 70 -> 60
Energy Usage: 2750 -> 2250
Movement Speed: 10 -> 11
Build Range: 45 -> 60

### Advanced Fabrication Flyer
Cost: 2400 -> 1950
Metal Usage: 60 -> 54
Energy Usage: 2500 -> 2250
Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Advanced Fabrication Vessel
Cost: 2700 -> 2400
Metal Usage: 90 -> 80
Movement Speed: 9 -> 10
Health: 675 -> 600

## WALKERS

### Peacekeeper
Movement Speed: 15 -> 16

### Purger
Cost: 50 -> 75
Health: 40 -> 10
Max Speed: 30 -> 25
Vision Radius: 50 -> 10
Radar Radius: 0 -> 70
Splash Damage: 150 -> 50
Splash Radius: 15 -> 10

## STARSHIPS

### Centurion:
*For some reason, the Legion team doubled the amount of projectiles that the Centurion fires against orbital targets. Other than this, the Centurion is statistically identical to the MLA Anchor.*

Projectiles per fire: 2 -> 1
