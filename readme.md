# Legion Balance for High Metal Moons
Version 0.01

## ECONOMY
*One major issue with Legion and MLA together in shared armies is that they cannot build their metal on the same spot together. In the past, this would be problematic because Legion T1 Mass Extractor + MLA T2 Advanced Metal Extractor would generate 1 more metal per second than a pure Legion-only T1/T2 Mass setup or a pure MLA-only T1/T2 Mass setup.*

*These changes seek to amend that, and also to make balancing Legion across different types of maps easier.*

*There are a lot of ripple effects caused by this, and a good majority of the changes in this mod seek to address the effects this has on Legion's early-game economy.*

### Mass Extractor
Metal Production: 8 -> 7
Cost: 220 -> 170
Can now be built on top of MLA Advanced Metal Extractor.

### Advanced Mass Extractor
Metal Production: 14 -> 15
Cost: 2200 -> 2000
Can now be built on top of MLA Metal Extractor.

### (MLA) Metal Extractor
Can now be built on top of Legion Advanced Mass Extractor.

### (MLA) Advanced Metal Extractor
Can now be built on top of Legion Mass Extractor.

### Rig
*The Rig is effectively just a 20% better Jig in the current orbital meta, as they can stack more metal production in the same radius of gas control.*

*We've decided to amend that by increasing the Rig's explosion radius and default build separation radius, while adjusting other numbers slightly too.*

Default Build Separation Radius: 100 -> 120
Explosion Radius: 250 -> 300
Explosion Full Damage Radius: 50 -> 60

## FABRICATORS

### Fabrication Walker
*Most competitive non-naval openings revolve heavily around the usage of MLA Bot Fabricators or Legion Fabrication Walkers. In order to compensate for the changes with T1 metal, we'll be adjusting the Fabrication Walker so it's a bit faster (albeit still slower than its MLA counterpart), costs less, and has the same fabrication rates as its MLA counterpart.*

*We hope the cheaper cost of a Fabrication Walker will help allow Legion players to get combat units onto the field earlier.*
Cost: 150 -> 135
Metal Usage: 9 -> 8
Energy Usage: 650 -> 600
Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
Health: 65 -> 50

### Armour Fabricator
*The MLA Fabrication Vehicle and Legion Armour Fabricator are much less commonly seen in openings. As a result, the speed of the Armour Fabricator is less important to the viability of Legion earlygame expansion.*

Cost: 200 -> 185
Metal Usage: 13 -> 11
Energy Usage: 850 -> 700
Build Range: 45 -> 55

### Fabrication Flyer
Cost: 225 -> 210
Metal Usage: 10 -> 9
Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Fabrication Ship
*Due to the sensitive nature of naval openings and the fact that MLA naval fabricators are already excruciatingly slow, we decided that it was best for the Fabrication Ship to have the same statistics as its MLA counterpart for now.*
Cost: 240 -> 200
Metal Usage: 16 -> 14
Energy Usage: 850 -> 800
Movement Speed: 9 -> 10

### Advanced Fabrication Walker
*We decided to take a similar approach here to the approach we took with the T1 Armour Fabricator*
Cost: 2000 -> 1800
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 2200 -> 1800
Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
Build Range: 45 -> 60
Health: 150 -> 250

### Advanced Armour Fabricator
Cost: 2250 -> 2025
Metal Usage: 70 -> 60
Energy Usage: 2750 -> 2250
Movement Speed: 10 -> 11
Build Range: 45 -> 60

### Advanced Fabrication Flyer
Cost: 2400 -> 1950
Metal Usage: 60 -> 54
Energy Usage: 2500 -> 2250
Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Advanced Fabrication Vessel
Cost: 2700 -> 2400
Metal Usage: 90 -> 80
Movement Speed: 9 -> 10
Health: 675 -> 600

##  FOUNDRIES
*Legion Foundries currently cost a bit more; their T1 Foundries specifically cost 10% more than MLA counterparts (without faster fabrication speed). This is particularly noticeable in T1. We've brought down Legion Foundry buildcosts to be in line with MLA. This will hopefully allow them to act more aggressively in the earlygame.*

*We've also had to adjust some Legion Foundry energy usage to bring them in line with MLA too.*

### Walker Foundry
*We've also adjusted the walk-off time on the Walker Foundry in order to make it more competitive against the Bot Factory in the very early game. This might have some unintended mid-game side-effects since the T1 Walker Foundry already scales nicely.*

*For reference, the MLA Bot Factory has a walk-off time of 3, and all other T1 Legion Foundries share walk-off times with their MLA equivalents.*
Cost: 660 -> 600
Energy Usage: 640 -> 675
Walk-off Time: 4 -> 3.5

### Armour Foundry
Cost: 660 -> 600
Energy Usage: 640 -> 675

### Flyer Foundry
*The Flyer Foundry inexplicably already uses 675 energy per second, unlike its fellow T1 non-Naval Foundries. Legion is a well-polished mod.*
Cost: 660 -> 600

### Ship Foundry
Cost: 660 -> 600

### Advanced Walker Foundry
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Armour Foundry
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Flyer Foundry
Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Ship Foundry
Metal Usage: 65 -> 60
Energy Usage: 1900 -> 1750

### Starcannon
*This is not an extremely well-known fact, but no factory in the game builds as fast as the Starcannon for its cost. For only 900 metal, you get production comparable to a 4500-metal T2 factory.*

*They aren't exactly commonly complained about though, so we won't touch them too much for now.*
Cost: 900 -> 1500
Metal Usage: 45 -> 35
Cooldown: 0 -> 10

## DEFENSES
*Legion defensive structures are currently notorious for being difficult to deal with. We've shifted balance a bit in order to make turtling slightly weaker as Legion.*

### Jackal
*Legion's ability to expand is partially impacted by the high expense of its defensive structures. We've thus made the Jackal both cheaper and weaker to encourage a slightly more rapid expansion rate for Legion players.*

Cost: 350 -> 300
Health: 750 -> 500
Fire Rate: 15 -> 12

### Scarab
Cost: 500 -> 400
Health: 2500 -> 1750
Damage: 300 -> 250
Fire Rate: 1 -> 0.8


### Hive
Health: 1000 -> 750
Ammo capacity: 2800 -> 3000
Ammo per shot: 1400 -> 1500
Range: 180 -> 165
### Spawned Swarm
Fire Rate: 5 -> 4

## ARMOUR

### Shank
Health: 300 -> 275
Fire Rate: 0.9 -> 0.7

### Scorpion
*Ever since the Leveler has had its range buffed to 140, the Scorpion hasn't been able to compete with it anymore. We've buffed its range to 160 as a result.*

*On the other hand, the Scorpion also has some insane scaling due to its excessive splash damage. We've increased its single-target DPS a bit to compensate for nerfing its splash damage.*

Health: 1650 -> 1400
Range: 140 -> 155
Fire Rate: 0.4 -> 0.5
Splash Range: 15 -> 7.5
Full Damage Splash Range: 4 -> 3
Splash damages allies: True -> False


## WALKERS

### Peacekeeper
Movement Speed: 15 -> 16

### Lancer
*The Lancer has always been problematic. It wants to be an anti-vehicle unit, but it has always been better at kiting Dox than fighting the Ant.*

*We want to restore the Lancer sniper fantasy, but balancing that is difficult.*
Movement Speed: 15 -> 12
Fire Rate: 0.61 -> 0.5
Damage: 125 -> 175
Range: 75 -> 100
Pitch Rate: 360 -> 45
Yaw Rate: 360 -> 45
Initial Projectile Velocity: 500 -> 100
Max Projectile Velocity: 500 -> 200
Projectile Lifetime: 0.28 -> 1
AT Commander modifier: 1.3 -> 1
AT Structure modifier: 1.3 -> 1
AT Vehicle modifier: 1.3 -> 1

### Patriot
Movement Speed: 15 -> 14

### Purger
Cost: 50 -> 60
Health: 40 -> 10
Speed: 30 -> 25
Vision Radius: 50 -> 10
Radar Radius: 0 -> 70
Splash Damage: 150 -> 50
Splash Radius: 15 -> 10

### Miniman
Speed: 7 -> 10
Damage: 500 -> 300

### Necromancer
*We wanted to encourage players to mix Necromancers into their main army composition. As a result, we removed the on-death explosion from the Necromancer.*

On death explosion: Removed
Health: 2500 -> 1000
Range: 180 -> 300
Charge Rate: 35 -> 60
Cost: 1400 -> 1200
Vision: 150 -> 250

*Side note: the Necromancer used to be less efficient than a factory at producing Purgers; it used 60 metal per Purger while the factory used 50 metal per Purger. However, since we nerfed Purgers to cost 60 metal, Necromancers now have the same metal efficiency as a factory for Purger production!*


## FLYERS

### Infiltrator
*The Infiltrator currently travels extremely slowly between planets. We've ammended that.*
Gravwell Multiplier: 1 -> 6

## ORBITAL STRUCTURES

### Centurion:
*For some reason, the Legion team doubled the amount of projectiles that the Centurion fires against orbital targets. Other than this, the Centurion is statistically identical to the MLA Anchor.*

Projectiles per fire: 2 -> 1

## STARSHIPS

### Viper
*The Viper is somewhat weaker for its cost than the Avenger, in normal circumstances. We've attempted to address that to some degree with a slight cost decrease.*

Cost: 350 -> 330

### Imperator
*For some reason, the Imperator is almost strictly better than its Omega counterpart. We've tried to amend this a bit with some nerfs to the Imperator's anti-orbital capabilities.*

Health: 5500 -> 3500
#### Fast Anti-Orbital Weapon
Range: 150 -> 120
Damage: 65 -> 50
#### Slow Anti-Orbital Weapon
Range: 250 -> 200
Fire Rate: 0.2 -> 0.16

### Tyr
*All the other Titans in the game cost 30000. We thought it was weird that the Tyr cost 40000. As a result, we decided to scale down the Tyr a bit.*

Cost: 40000 -> 30000
Damage: 300 -> 180
Health: 21000 -> 17500
