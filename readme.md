# Legion Balance for High Metal Moons
Version 0.01

## ECONOMY:
*One major issue with Legion and MLA together in shared armies is that they cannot build their metal on the same spot together. In the past, this would be problematic because Legion T1 Mass Extractor + MLA T2 Advanced Metal Extractor would generate 1 more metal per second than a pure Legion-only T1/T2 Mass setup or a pure MLA-only T1/T2 Mass setup.*

*These changes seek to amend that, and also to make balancing Legion across different types of maps easier.*

*There are a lot of ripple effects caused by this, and a good majority of the changes in this mod seek to address the effects this has on Legion's early-game economy.*

### Mass Extractor:
Metal Production: 8 -> 7
Cost: 220 -> 170
Can now be built on top of MLA Advanced Metal Extractor.

### Advanced Mass Extractor:
Metal Production: 14 -> 15
Cost: 2200 -> 2000
Can now be built on top of MLA Metal Extractor.

### (MLA) Metal Extractor:
Can now be built on top of Legion Advanced Mass Extractor.

### (MLA) Advanced Metal Extractor:
Can now be built on top of Legion Mass Extractor.

### Rig:
*The Rig is effectively just a 20% better Jig in the current orbital meta, as they can stack more metal production in the same radius of gas control.*

*I've decided to amend that by increasing the Rig's explosion radius and default build separation radius, while adjusting other numbers slightly too.*

Default Build Separation Radius: 100 -> 120
Explosion Radius: 250 -> 300
Explosion Full Damage Radius: 50 -> 60
